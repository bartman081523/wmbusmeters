## Purpose

When implementing code whose behaviour is defined by an external standard
(data-record formats, protocol encodings, type tables, driver behaviour,
spec clauses), correct behaviour is defined by the standard — not by
intuition, not by memory, not by analogy to other codebases. When you
don't yet know something — a data type, an encoding, a clause — research
it before writing code. The spec landscape itself lives in
`project-specs.md`; do not duplicate it here.

## Sources of truth

1. **This repository** is ground truth for *this project*. Read its
   source, tests, and CI configuration. If the repo and your memory
   disagree, trust the repo.
2. **The standards and comparison implementations** used by this project
   are catalogued in `project-specs.md` — go there for *which* sources
   matter; come back here for *how* to use them.

## Discipline

- **Evidence-first.** Tie every factual claim to a specific source: a
  `file:line` in this repo, a clause/table in the applicable standard,
  or a function in a comparison implementation. A claim with no source
  is a hypothesis — label it as such.
- **Cite the spec in code.** When implementing spec-defined behaviour,
  cite the clause in a one-line comment, matching the project's house
  style, e.g. `// <STANDARD> <CLAUSE>: …`.
- **Don't invent.** Implement only behaviour backed by the standard (see
  `project-specs.md` for which standards apply). Comparison
  implementations are useful for cross-checking but are not authoritative
  — if you can point to no source, leave a `// TODO` and ask before
  implementing. Do not invent data types, encodings, or unit suffixes.
- **Controlled units.** Units (or analogous enumerated vocabularies) are
  controlled; see `project-specs.md` for where the project's unit table
  lives and how to extend it. Add a real entry rather than synthesising
  strings on the fly.
- **Verify against the repo, not assumptions.** Reproduce a failing case
  before fixing; treat the root cause, not the symptom.
- **Flag the unknowns.** If you cannot verify something, say so and leave
  a `// TODO` rather than guessing.

## Cross-checking decoding

For spec-defined data-record decoding (format-specific headers, type
tables, compact profiles, date/time types, etc.), comparison
implementations are useful — see `project-specs.md` for which
implementations this project compares against. The rule of thumb: where
this project and a comparison implementation differ, the standard (not
the comparison) decides, because this project often covers more of the
standard than the comparison does.
